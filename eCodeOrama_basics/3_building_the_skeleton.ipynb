    "* How to convert an `.sb3` file to a `.json` file\n",
    "* How to parse and show its contents\n",
    "* How to modify a `.json` file\n",

    "Now that we know the basics, let's focus on how we can utilize the JSON file for codeOrama and eCodeOrama. In codeOrama, each solumn represents a sprite and each row represents an event. Each cell contains scripts of the corresponding sprite that are called on the corresponding event. I think a good stepping stone would be to write a little script that builds the **skeleton** of codeOrama, namely the top row of sprites and first column of events.\n",
