# My codeOramas

Here I present some of the codeOramas that I personally developed for teams that advanced to the final stage of the Panhellenic STEM Educational Robotics Competition. I have also uploaded the slides I used in my "Scratch and codeOrama" presentation during Logotreeâ€™s 2nd Panhellenic Conference.
